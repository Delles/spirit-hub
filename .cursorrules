# Cursor Rules for SpiritHub.ro

## Always Include Agent Guidelines

Before starting any task, read and follow the guidelines in `agents.md`. These guidelines define how AI agents should behave when working on this codebase.

## Key Reminders

- **Plan before implementing** - Always create a clear plan before writing code
- **Romanian UI only** - All user-facing text must be in Romanian
- **Respect project structure** - Follow conventions in `Structure.md`
- **Code is documentation** - Prefer clear naming over excessive comments
- **No unnecessary markdown** - Don't create extra documentation files

## Documentation Files

- `agents.md` - Agent behavior guidelines (ALWAYS READ THIS FIRST)
- `product.md` - Product specifications and requirements
- `Structure.md` - Project architecture and folder structure
- `Tech.md` - Technology stack and development guidelines

## Workflow

1. **Context Gathering**: Read relevant files and understand the current state
2. **Planning**: Create a clear plan and present it before implementing
3. **Implementation**: Follow the plan, respect conventions, use Romanian for UI
4. **Cleanup**: Remove debug code, ensure self-documenting code, no extra markdown files

Refer to `agents.md` for complete guidelines and workflows.
